Hello World!
============

This is a reboot of my old website. I have switched from a worpress site to a simple static site built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

This website marks a turning point in my programming adventure. I feel ready to put myself out there. Make a name. All that jazz. Here are some reasons explaing why I made this website. 

 * Branding. I'm under the impression that a nice website with respectable client is more powerful than a simple resume. 
 * Output. Having a venue to share my work gives me the motivation to do it right and follow through. 
 * Work. This website gives a concrete foundation to built upon.
 * Every one else. I have learned an absurd amount from the website of inspired individuals. I can only hope that I will add value to many online communities through my efforts here. 

So here it is! Welcome to *if(Thermal)*.
